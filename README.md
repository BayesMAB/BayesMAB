Bayesian Multi-Armed Bandit (BayesMAB) algorithm for bid shading

The dataset used in the paper cannot be made public, but we provide a simulated dataset in the "/data" folder.

Set mdate (e.g. 20231021) and method_name arguments in bid_shading_e_e.py.

Run bid_shading_e_e.py for a complete train-test experiment.

The results will be saved in the "/result" folder. The result name follows the scheme "evaluation_result_{run_time}_{test_file_name}_{method_name}.json".
